# Tone without delay

I'm trying to work through using the arduino tone function witout delay similiar to the blink without delay.

Really, this should be a proof of concept folder in my [pegasus plinko project repository](https://github.com/chris-schmitz/pegasus), but I forsee running into the need for this concept frequently in the future so I wanted to work out the core structure and thought process separately so I could refer back to it more easily in the future.
